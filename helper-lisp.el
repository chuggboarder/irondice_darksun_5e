;; it also looks like I should install the DnD styles system wide into my TeX environment. So I'm set up to make other DnD styled things and store them wherever.

;; I used trial and error instead.  I kept running latex and downloading the missing files in the repo with my character sheet and rerunning it until it worked.



;; When I make some edits and I'm ready to refresh my sheet, I navigate into the
